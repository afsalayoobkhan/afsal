# Cattle Behavioral Analysis

This repository contains data and analysis related to the behavior of cattle across different farmlets.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes observations of cattle behavior, quantifying various states like Active, Relaxed, Fearful, Agitated, Calm, Content, Indifferent, and Frustrated. These behaviors have been recorded across different farmlets and at various times.

## Descriptive Statistics

The dataset provides the following key statistics for each behavioral state:

- Active: Mean = 8.09, Std. Dev = 1.51
- Relaxed: Mean = 8.15, Std. Dev = 1.86
- Fearful: Mean = 0.62, Std. Dev = 0.65
- Agitated: Mean = 0.86, Std. Dev = 0.85
- Calm: Mean = 9.05, Std. Dev = 1.53
- Content: Mean = 8.64, Std. Dev = 1.58
- Indifferent: Mean = 2.69, Std. Dev = 2.21
- Frustrated: Mean = 0.86, Std. Dev = 0.74

## Comparative Analysis

A comparative analysis of behavioral states across different farmlets (R, G, B) was conducted. The analysis revealed variations in average scores of each behavioral state among the farmlets, providing insights into the prevalence of certain behaviors in specific farmlets.

## Further Analysis

Additional analyses such as time-series analysis or correlation analysis can be conducted to understand trends over time or relationships between different behavioral states. This would require a detailed understanding of the frequency and duration of observations.

## Usage

This analysis can assist in understanding cattle behavior in different environmental settings, which can be crucial for farm management, animal welfare, and research purposes.
